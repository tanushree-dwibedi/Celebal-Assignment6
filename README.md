Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
Trained multiple machine learning models and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. Analyze the results to select the best-performing model.
